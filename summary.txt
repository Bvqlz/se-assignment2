What I learned about velocity is that it is only measured by counting the amount of story points that
are fully completed during a sprint iteration. Velocity helps teams then understand the pace that are doing 
for the next sprint. This velocity can also change as its not always the case that a team completes the same amount
of story points in a single iteration.

As for burndown charts, they help create a visual of a team's progress during a timeframe. This also helps to quickly
identify if a team is on pace by having an ideal burn rate or if they are behind and and need to calculate an new burn rate for 
a certain deadline. Even then, it helps a team understand where they are and the steps that they can take forward that best fits their situation.
